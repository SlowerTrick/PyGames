# 🎮 Silksong Demake

**Silksong Demake** is a fan-made 2D action-platformer inspired by *Hollow Knight: Silksong*, built entirely with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
All sprites and animations were created using **Aseprite**, giving the game a handcrafted pixel-art style faithful to the original.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
Experience fast-paced movement, precise platforming, and responsive combat — all recreated from scratch.  
The player can **jump**, **dash**, **attack**, **heal**, and perform **special moves**, just like in the original game.

## 🧩 Features
- ⚔️ Smooth combat and multiple attack types (neutral, throw, spin, parry)  
- 💨 Dash, wall jump, and platform interactions  
- 🎧 Dynamic audio system with pitch variations  
- ⏱️ Custom timer system for animations, cooldowns, and i-frames  
- 🎮 Support for Xbox and PS4 controllers  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created as a **personal challenge and learning exercise** to explore game development concepts,  
physics simulation, and animation handling using pure Python.

## 🚀 How to Run
If on **Windows**, install the precompiled version. 
Else clone the DEMO SK/ folder and compile the game starting at Code/ folder with pyinstaller or a similar tool
